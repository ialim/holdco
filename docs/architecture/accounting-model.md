# Accounting Model

## Core Principles
- Double-entry accounting
- Group-level Chart of Accounts with per-company ledger accounts
- VAT is isolated and never treated as income
- Intercompany balances must net to zero at group level

## VAT Handling (Embedded)
VAT Rate: 7.5%
Formula:
VAT = Gross * (VAT Rate / (1 + VAT Rate))
Example: VAT = Gross * (0.075 / 1.075)

## Monthly Close
- Inventory reconciliation
- VAT payable confirmation
- Tax provisioning
- Intercompany reconciliation
